## CODE

- train all seasons for every player at once
-- might have to combine tables
- use every stat
- erase injuries from prediction/compenstae from them with a read out after removing injured players/ produce a per GP result instead?
- make readME/even better comments

- train for buildup in performace?? ie projected performance based on last 5 years? might be doing that if we do above

## Ideas
- graph different parameter selection
- automate parameter selection
- insert output in table
- use GAR stat
-
