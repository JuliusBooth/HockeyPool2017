## CODE
- teams stats
- other versions of stats (from diff people)
- use more stats
- point share
- make readME/even better comments
- train for buildup in performace?? ie projected performance based on last 5 years? might be doing that if we do above

## Ideas
- graph different parameter selection
- automate parameter selection
- insert output in table
- use GAR stat
